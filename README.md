# Sendalo


Sendalo is a mock of a money remittance app intended for people who have no access to traditional financial services in the US. It lets you see how much money you would have for retirement if you save a percentage of the money you usually send. It also converts from USD dollars to the local currency using an exchange rate from an API.
